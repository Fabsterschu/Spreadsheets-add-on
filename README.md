This is a simple spreadsheets addon i have created



so basically you are gonna want to go to your spreadsheet (or create a new one)
and click on the "extra" menu
now go to scripteditor 
if you are there delete all the code you see,
and paste mine now click save (ctrl+s) or run
make sure you authorise by clicking the right button then click you gmail acc
then in the left corner of the pop-up window press advanced
then down click continue to (the name you gave your project) it should say (unsafe) but dont worry its nothing
now just scroll down and press the right button again
and you are done! just go back to your spreadsheet and look at the menu
if it doesnt show up just try to run the script again it should work now
